# Crowdfunding_ETL
Project 2 repository

This ETL mini project, worked with a partner to practice building an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and either Python dictionary methods or regular expressions to extract and transform the data. After transforming  the data, new CSV files are created. A new data base schema diagram is created using the CSV files and their data into a Postgres database.

The following are the file information in the repository:

## CrowdFunding_DBD.png has the database ERD diagram for the schema.

## crowdfunding_db_schema.sql has the create table scripts for the schema tables.

## campaign_select.png,category_select.png,sub_category_select.png and contacts_select.png has screenshots of the select query run after import data from the generated csv files.

## contacts.csv has cleaned dataframe with data from contacts.xlsx

## ETL_Mini_Project_APandian_ZBlackburn.ipynb is the final jupyter notebook that was used for creating data frames and csv files.
